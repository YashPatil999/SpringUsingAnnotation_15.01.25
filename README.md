Spring Annotations Overview

Spring annotations simplify the configuration and development of applications by reducing the need for verbose XML configurations. These annotations are used to define beans, manage dependencies, and configure various aspects of the Spring Framework.

This document provides an overview of commonly used Spring annotations with examples.

1. @Component

Marks a Java class as a Spring bean, allowing it to be auto-detected during classpath scanning.

2. @Controller

3. @ComponentScan
